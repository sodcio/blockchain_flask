# Mini-project to study the principles of blockchain and flask.

A blockchain originally block chain,is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.

To run the web application, you must run in the command line:
~/blockchain_flask/app$ python3 main.py
And in the web browser go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
